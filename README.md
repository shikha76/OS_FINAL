# OS Job Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms with an interactive interface, quiz system, and AI recommendations.

## Features
- Multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Interactive visualization of scheduling results
- Quiz system to test knowledge
- AI-based algorithm recommendations
- Process input system for custom scenarios

## Setup Instructions
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Enter process details (Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time)
2. Select scheduling algorithm
3. View results and visualizations
4. Take quizzes to test your knowledge
5. Get AI recommendations based on your scenario
